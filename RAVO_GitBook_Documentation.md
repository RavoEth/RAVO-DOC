## 🧠 Core Concepts

### Virtual Bonding Curves

**Virtual Bonding Curves** are the cornerstone of RAVO's innovation. Unlike traditional AMMs that require upfront liquidity, our virtual curves provide instant liquidity through mathematical algorithms.

#### How It Works

```
Price = Initial Price × (Total Supply / Initial Supply)^Exponent
```

**Key Advantages:**
- ✅ **No Initial Liquidity Required**: Start trading immediately
- ✅ **Dynamic Pricing**: Price adjusts automatically based on supply/demand
- ✅ **Infinite Liquidity**: Mathematical guarantee of available liquidity
- ✅ **Fair Launch**: Everyone starts on equal footing

#### Curve Types

1. **Linear Curve**: Steady price increase with supply
2. **Exponential Curve**: Accelerated price growth
3. **Custom Curve**: Tailored to your project's needs

### Migration System

When your token reaches critical mass, RAVO automatically migrates it to **Uniswap V2** for maximum liquidity and exposure.

#### Migration Process

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Token Created] --> B[Active Trading]
    B --> C[Accumulate ETH]
    C --> D{ETH ≥ Threshold?}
    D -->|No| B
    D -->|Yes| E[Migration Triggered]
    E --> F[Trading Paused]
    F --> G[Uniswap Pool Created]
    G --> H[Migration Complete]
    H --> I[Trading Resumes on Uniswap]
```

#### Migration States

- **🟢 Pre-Migration**: Active trading, accumulating funds
- **🟡 Migration in Progress**: Trading temporarily disabled
- **🔴 Migration Failed**: Automatic retry mechanism
- **✅ Migration Complete**: Successfully moved to Uniswap

### Fee Distribution

RAVO operates on a transparent **3-way fee distribution** system:

#### Fee Structure
- **1% Transaction Fee** (maximum 2%)
- **Distributed as follows:**

| Recipient | Percentage | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Token Creator** | 50% | Project development and growth |
| **RAVO Team** | 25% | Platform maintenance and innovation |
| **Buyback & Partnerships** | 25% | Ecosystem expansion and token value |

#### Fee Benefits

- 💰 **Creator Rewards**: Direct incentives for successful launches
- 🔄 **Sustainable Platform**: Funds platform growth and features
- 📈 **Value Accrual**: Buyback mechanism increases token value
- 🤝 **Ecosystem Growth**: Partnership funds expand opportunities
